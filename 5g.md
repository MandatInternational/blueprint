# 5G blueprint

5G has introduced the concept of modularization in its design. With this
ubiquitous modular architecture, 5G allows telco and IT worlds to meet and thus
outstanding innovations follow with the so-called post-5G propositions.

With all this, researchers have a wonderful object to experiments new ideas at
all the levels. Unfortunately, as every single detail count deploying a
full-fledged 5G remains a matter of specialists who have to choose the right
combination of software, hardware, and locations of the infrastructure. This may
divert researchers from their core research as they may have to invest
substantial amount of time and money just to setup their experimental platform.

The objective of this blueprint is to provide the community with a set of
**replicable software, hardware, and methodology to make experimental research
with cutting edge 5G environments**.

In fact, this blueprint is designed in a modular way such that one can either
deploy it fully or only partially. For example, people only interested in 5G can
only deploy the core and use a simulated RAN, while people interested only in
the RAN can just deploy a RAN, assuming they have access to a core (e.g., via
the SLICES central node or another partner). Advanced users may even deploy a
core and connect it with multiple RANs. In addition, the blueprint describes a
workflow to achieve reproducible research.

This blueprint is built around a fundamental experiment, described step-by-step
and seconded by an open source reference implementation, that can be used as a
baseline:

* for researchers to exercise their experimental research;
* for the SLICES community to build the SLICES infrastructure.

## Canonical 5G experiments

In this blueprint, we propose a canonical experiment with a 5G network presented
below where the 5G core and RAN are deployed in separate clusters that are
remotely connected.

The experiment consists in measuring the delay incurred by the infrastructure
(RAN components + core components) for 3 different deployment scenarios.

> The scenarios have been chosen to serve the purpose of the blueprint, namely
> serve as a baseline for experimenters and infrastructure owners and operators.
> They highlight software and hardware requirements as well as operational
> challenges.

### One cluster

In this scenario, the minimum 5G and RAN is considered. All functions are
deployed in the same cluster of resources. This scenario defines the software
and hardware that are needed to run 5G-related experiments.

### Core / RAN separation

In this scenario, the core and the RAN networks are deployed using independent
clusters of resources. Resources are from different parties (e.g., the core is
run and managed by country A and the RAN by country B).

This scenario highlights the need for strategies to ensure that parties can
interoperate. To interconnect the core and the RAN, it is necessary to use
specific network interconnections. Several challenges happen here. First the
cluster of resource becomes permeable to network exchanges from the outside
world. Second, a well-provisioned network connectivity must be establish to
carry the traffic between the clusters of resources.

In addition to technical point, policies have to be defined. One may notice that
we only consider one UPF and this UPF is in the core. This location has been
chosen to accentuate the need of careful definition of policies. Indeed, it is
expected that the UE gets Internet from the UPF, meaning that the operator of
the core network become an Internet Service Provider for third parties (i.e.,
the RAN network).

## Research methodology

As extensively discussed in the
[reproducibility chapter](README.md#reproducible-research) of the blueprint,
experiments follow cycles that can be decomposed in three cycles[[^pos]]:

* the **setup phase** where resources are provisioned and configured;

* the **measurement/experiment phase** where the experiment actually happens;

* the **evaluation phase** where results are extracted, analyzed, and archived
for subsequent analysis and validation.
