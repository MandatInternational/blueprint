SLICES blueprint

## The blueprint concept

The *blueprint* is a fundamental component in programme management that
guarantees to keep the focus on what is needed to deliver the expected changes
to the programme on time.

The key for the success of an ambitious projects such as SLICES is to take
enough time, effort, and rigour at the head of the programme to set the vision,
requirements, and culture [[^1]].

In SLICES, we leverage the concept of blueprint to ease collaboration between
engineers and non-engineers in order to define and implement this ambitious
scientific infrastructure.

As such, we define a common terminology that doesn't require in-depth, technical
knowledge to produce consistent vision on the application with a focus on the
future objective[[^2]]. But as the devil is in the details, the accompany the
blueprint with a set of reference implementations.

The blueprint is documented and discussed with the community and is built
iteratively[[^3]]. In each cycle, we pick up the right actors to review and
validate the advances made so far and check their adequacy with the baseline.
Each iteration is used to refine the definition of the SLICES infrastructure.

Each iteration being a refinement of the previous one, we progress in parallel
with with blueprint components. At the current stage, we are iterating on the
*5G* and the *Cloud+Edge* components of the blueprint.
